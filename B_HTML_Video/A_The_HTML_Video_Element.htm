How it Works

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. 
If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. 
The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.
